1. What is the difference between JAR and RUNNABLE-JAR?
Ans:
  The runnable jar contains a MANIFEST.MF file, which defines the Main class to be executed when the jar is run.
  Non-runnable jars are just libraries of classes, that can be added to the classpath so that code is reused 
  (it also contains the manifest file, but no main class there)

5. How many boolean compare operators are there in Java?
Ans: 5, 
      for AND &, &&
      for OR |, ||
      for XOR ^
      && and || are short-circuted, that means if first one is valid, it wont check the second parameter.
