-- what is logstash?
logstash: logs -> reading (logstash) -> kafka/any-other-target
works: listening, able to recongnize changes in a file, and pass it on the changed-bits to target

-- what is the challenge we got?
challenge: logs are in remote machine:

1. REMOTE windows share, input? readable
	input in this fashion
		input-file=\\\\blrkecperfcoe2\\latest\\CitiSHare
		-- make every back slash twice

2. REMOTE linux machine, NETWORK FILE SYSTEM, NFS
	source => windows, destination => linux
	other alternatives like, samba
	CATCH: we are using RHEL, cifs, COMMON INTERNET FILE SYSTEM

-- what alternatives we have?
Scenario:

   REMOTE:				LOCAL:
   ------				-----
(1)logs,windows share			logstash->kafka
(2)logs->lnfs				local-dir->logstash->kafka
(3)logs->logstash			kafka

(4)logs->logstash-forwarder		logstash->kafka

-- why 4th option, logstash-forwarder?
due to light-weight code, not cpu/memory hungry

-- about logstash-forwarder
1. written in GO language
2. source files zip, then need to compile by GO language compilers
https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder

-- how to get files inside the LINUX BOX? 
BY cifs MOUNTING

-- to mount windows share in rhel/fedora use this cmd then provide password of windows share
$ mount -t cifs //blrkecperfcoe2/latest/CitiSHare /mnt/jnfs --verbose -o user=jagadishkumar_t

-- prerequisites for logstash-forwarder?
GO language
-> get from, https://golang.org/dl/
-> select linux, download, unzip

-- how to compile logstash-forwarder, command? inside the logstash-forwarder-master folder
$ go build -o logstash-forwarder
	
-- how to create CERT/KEY?
login to the machine where logstash-forwarder is there, then execute the below command (here VILIMSHYO7 is host where logstash server resides)
$ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash-forwarder.key -out logstash-forwarder.crt -days 365 -subj /CN=VILIMSHYD07

-- where to put the CERT/KEY?
CERT in, $CERT like, export CERT=/etc/pki/tls/certs/logstash-forwarder
KEY in, $KEY like, /etc/pki/tls/private/logstash-forwarder

-- how to copy files between linux servers/systems?
$ scp source-file user@host:location/destination-file

$ scp logstash-forwarder.crt root@VILIMSHYD07:$CERT/

$ scp logstash-forwarder.key root@VILIMSHYD07:$KEY/


-- how to write conf file for logstash-forwarder?
copy from the github link
-> modify the host:port in the beginning like, "servers": [ "VILIMSHYD07:6783" ]
-> modify file-paths for KEY like,  "ssl key": "$KEY/logstash-forwarder.key"
-> modfiy file-path for CERT like,  "ssl ca": "$CERT/logstash-forwarder.crt"
-> add this path in the end like,  
{
      "paths": [
        "/root/jagadishkumar_t/sample.log"
      ],
      "fields":{ "type": "jagadishlog" }

-- how to write conf file for logstash?
copy from github link, inside lumberjack
modify port,CERT,KEY
make sure PORT number is same on both files

-- once done, sequence of starting the machines?
First, logstash on local
Second, logstash-forwarder on remote

-- how to start logstash server in VERBOSE mode at receiver/LOCAL end?
$ ./logstash -vv -f logstash-forwarder.conf

-- how to start logstash-forwarder? (yourstuff.json is the CONF file, can also be renamed as yourstuff.conf, both works)
$ ./logstash-forwarder -config yourstuff.json

-- how to test?
add few lines in REMOTE machine's sample.log
see the stdout in LOCAL machine's CONSOLE

-- what issues might be faced?
1. copy the tar.gz files into the linux boxes
2. intsalling GO language
3. building logstash-forwarder by compiling using GO language
4. disable firewall issues, check iptables
5. creating tailor made certificates
6. copy cert and key to other linux box
7. changing ports if needed
8. lumberjack protocol

things which are not clear in github link:
-----------------------------------------

--last $ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash-forwarder.key -out logstash-forwarder.crt -days 365
--fast $ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout lumberjack.key -out lumberjack.crt -subj /CN=logstash.example.com

-- this works
--mine $ openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout logstash-forwarder.key -out logstash-forwarder.crt -days 365 -subj /CN=VILIMSHYD07


-- notes:
either you change certificate or port or file-name. Anything used inside config, it need to be restarted.
make sure to use the same port in both CONF files
