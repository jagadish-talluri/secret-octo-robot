Question: Which charger to buy in the market if I need fast charging capability?

Answer: You need a charger which has high watt score. For example, if you got 5W, 12W and 20W charger, go for 20W for fast charging.

OnePlus Dash => 5V x 4A == 20W
iPhone Default => 5V x 1A == 5W
Kindle Charger => 5V x 1A == 5W
Bose Charger => 5V x 1.6A == 8W
Lenovo Charger => 5.2V x 2A == 10.2 ~= 10W

Power Bank => 5.1V x 3.6A == 18W

Battery => Stores Charge => measured in => MAH (milli-amp-hour) like 4000 mah
Bucket => Stores Water => measured in => Liters (volume) like 10 liters

so a 25L bucket => has a capacity to store 25L water

moving electrons => called => electricity or current
still electrons => called => charge

Charger => Fills Charge in battery
Hose => Fills Water in bucket

P = I x V --> notation

Power = Current x Voltage --> type

Watt = Amp x Volt --> units

ex: 1100 Watts hair dryer, can be operated
	a. Europe => 5A x 220V => 1100 watts
	b. USA => 10A x 110V => 1100 watts
This hair dryer needs 1100 watts to be functional.
How much current is running in the circute 5A or 10A based on the country.

forget; power vs energy

We get our bills with different units:

Electricity Bill => 5 units => 5 KWH (kilo-watt-hour)
Battery => 12 Volts
Hair Dryer => 1100 Watts
Vaccum Cleaner => 15 Amps of sucking power

Electricity To Flow => and => Work to be happend

Electrical Pressure => called => voltage

water flow from high altitude to low altitude: difference in height leads to water moving from high to low
current flow from <> : difference in (potential difference or voltage) leads to electrons moving from one point to other point

Appliances Circutes are designed to accept a certain amount of volts inside or else wont work.

WH or KWH => unit of energy, tells how much energy is consumed per chunk of time
(just because it has hour; it is not unit of time :-) )

Ampere => a bunch of electrons flowing through a certain point per second.
			(so we can say speed of electron flow) :: bunch = 6.24 x 10^18
AmpHour => a measure of capacity; how much charge a battery can hold

2AH -> we can draw 2A per 1 hour
2AH -> we can draw 1A per 2 hour
2AH -> we can draw 4A per half hour

battery life (hours) = capacity(AH)/Load(A);
charge = stored energy

Volts x Amp-Hours = Watt-Hour

ex: 2 batteries, both have same 1200 mah capacity
	a. small battery => 2000mah of 1.2 v 
		2AH x 1.2 V = 2.4 WH
	b. big battery => 2000mah of 9.6 v 
		2AH x 9.6 V = 19.2 WH

C rating => informal way of telling how much current it can deliver safely
	
efficiency of a battery is a whole differnt story:
we want batteries:
	1. to charge fast
	2. to discharge slow
	3. not to heat up in fast charging
	4. not to heat up in fast discharging
	5. longer life
	6. many battery cycles
	7.
